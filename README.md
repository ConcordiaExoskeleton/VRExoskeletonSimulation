# VRExoskeletonSimulation

## Overview

This project is a VR testing simulation designed for wireless virtual reality headsets (Tested on Meta Quest 3) paired with usage of an exoskeleton to evaluate and test the efficacy of different exoskeleton designs in a construction environments as a standarized test. It's goal is to simulates tasks like lifting, carrying, placing, and tying rebar in a realistic outdoor construction site environment.

## Features

#### Core features:

- Back support exoskeleton testing mode
    - rebar tying simulation of a 6m x 6m with 25cm spacing work zone
- Arm support exoskeleton testing mode
- Tutorial UI for each scene
- Realistic construction site environment
- Physics-based object interaction
- Progress/Completion feedback

#### Other features:

- Audio and haptic feedback
- Menu scene with scene selection
- Modular design for future task additions
- Support for direct interactor input
