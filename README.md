# VRExoskeletonSimulation

## Overview

This project is a VR testing simulation designed for wireless virtual reality headsets (Tested on the Meta Quest 3) to evolve towards new standardized evaluation of occupational exoskeleton efficacy in construction environments. The simulation enables users to perform realistic, physically dmanding tasks that are tailored to the specific exoskeleton such as tying rebars with a back support exoskeleton. The goal is to have a controlled virtual scenarios in order to assess the efficacy of the different exoskeleton designs through repeatable, measurable test cases.

## Features

#### Core features:

- Back support exoskeleton test case
   - rebar tying simulation of a 6m x 6m with 25cm spacing work zone (625 intersection to tie)
   - simulated construction environment
- Arm support exoskeleton test case
   - shelf building simulation of screwing in two support, 3 screw per support, per shelf
   - simulated room environment
- Tutorial video for:
   - Controls
   - Navigation
   - Rules
   - Test conduction
- Hand tracking (controller free, can freely switch between both modes)
- Direct interactors (no ray interaction, nor teleportation)
- Progress/Completion feedback

## Hardware Requirements

- VR headset (Tested on Meta Quest 3)
- Compatible PC with Meta Quest Link
- Installed Meta Quest app (for developer mode)
- USB-C cable for connecting Quest to PC (if using wired link)
- Exoskeleton

## How to Run

1. **Enable Developer Mode** on your Meta Quest 3:
   - Open the **Meta Quest app** on your mobile device.
   - Go to **Settings > Developer Mode** and enable it.

2. **Connect to PC**:
   - Use **Meta Quest Link** via USB-C or Air Link to connect the headset to your Unity development environment.

3. **Unity Setup**:
   - Install Unity with the **Android Build Support** module.
   - Open the project in Unity Hub.
   - Go to **Edit > Project Settings**
   - Under **XR Plug-in Management**, enable **OpenXR** for Android.
   - Go to **File > Build Settings**.
   - Select **Android** as the platform and click **Switch Platform**.
   

4. **Build and Run**:
   - Connect your headset via USB.
   - Select your headset in the **Build Settings > Run Device** dropdown.
   - Click **Build and Run** to deploy directly to the headset.

## Authors and acknowledgment

**Developed by:** Intern [Kevin Wu](https://github.com/ToasterBuilder) and Intern [Rida Chaarani](https://github.com/RiChaarani)

**Special thanks:** PhD Professor Dr. Amin Hammad and Concordia university for lending and providing access to occupational exoskeletons, virtual reality headsets and other essential resources that made this project possible.

## Project status

ðŸš§ **Minimum Viable Product Achieved - Still in Development**  
The core simulation is functional with two distinct test cases (arm support and back support). Users can navigate between scenes, perform different tasks, and collect basic performance data in a controlled VR environment. While the foundation is solid, the project is still under development.
