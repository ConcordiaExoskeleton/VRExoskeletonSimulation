# VRExoskeletonSimulation

## Overview

This project is a VR testing simulation designed for wireless virtual reality headsets (Tested on the Meta Quest 3) to evolve towards new standardized evaluation of occupational exoskeleton efficacy in construction environments. The simulation enables users to perform realistic, physically dmanding tasks that are tailored to the specific exoskeleton such as tying rebars with a back support exoskeleton. The goal is to have a controlled virtual scenarios in order to assess the efficacy of the different exoskeleton designs through repeatable, measurable test cases.

## Features

#### Core features:

- Back support exoskeleton testing mode
    - rebar tying simulation of a 6m x 6m with 25cm spacing work zone
- Arm support exoskeleton testing mode
- Tutorial UI for each scene
- Realistic construction site environment
- Physics-based object interaction
- Progress/Completion feedback

#### Other features:

- Audio and haptic feedback
- Menu scene with scene selection
- Modular design for future task additions
- Support for direct interactor input

## Hardware Requirements

- VR headset (Tested on Meta Quest 3)
- Compatible PC with Meta Quest Link
- Installed Meta Quest app (for developer mode)
- USB-C cable for connecting Quest to PC (if using wired link)
- Exoskeleton

## How to Run

1. **Enable Developer Mode** on your Meta Quest 3:
   - Open the **Meta Quest app** on your mobile device.
   - Go to **Settings > Developer Mode** and enable it.

2. **Connect to PC**:
   - Use **Meta Quest Link** via USB-C or Air Link to connect the headset to your Unity development environment.

3. **Unity Setup**:
   - Install Unity with the **Android Build Support** module.
   - Open the project in Unity Hub.
   - Go to **Edit > Project Settings**
   - Under **XR Plug-in Management**, enable **OpenXR** for Android.
   - Go to **File > Build Settings**.
   - Select **Android** as the platform and click **Switch Platform**.
   

4. **Build and Run**:
   - Connect your headset via USB.
   - Select your headset in the **Build Settings > Run Device** dropdown.
   - Click **Build and Run** to deploy directly to the headset.

## Authors and acknowledgment

**Developed by:** Intern [Kevin Wu](https://github.com/ToasterBuilder) and Intern [Rida Chaarani](https://github.com/RiChaarani)

**Special thanks:** PhD Professor Dr. Amin Hammad and Concordia university for lending and providing access to occupational exoskeletons, virtual reality headsets and other essential resources that made this project possible.

## Project status

ðŸš§ **Minimum Viable Product Achieved - Still in Development**  
The core simulation is functional with two distinct test cases (arm support and back support). Users can navigate between scenes, perform different tasks, and collect basic performance data in a controlled VR environment. While the foundation is solid, the project is still under development.
